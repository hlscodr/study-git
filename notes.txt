Chapter 8 Notes

Developing locally 
Create local directory and initialize to a git repository:
git init -b main (master is the default branch)

Add to the stage area
Add git files to the staging area
git add file.txt

Add a commit
git commit -m “adding a note”

Observe a repository log
Locally, observe the commit track, where current pointer, and which branch
git log

Deleting a branch
Delete a remote branch and the associated remote-tracking branch
git push <shortname> -d <branch_name>
example: git push origin -d feature

Delete a local branch
git branch -d <branch__name>
example: git branch -d feature

Switch to another branch
git switch main

Remote Tracking Branches represent the state of remote branches

git branch -vv
Used to see if upstream branches are defined (-vv stands for very verbose)
git status
This can tell if your local branch is ahead or behind the main/origin upstream branch
List the local branches and their upstream branches, if they have any.

git branch —all List both remote-tracking branches and local branches. Combine with --list to match optional pattern(s)


Keep up with remote-tracking
git push
git status
git log

Deleting Branches
git push <shortname> -d <branch_name>
